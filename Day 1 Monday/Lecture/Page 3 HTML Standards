HTML Standards

To understand the use of HTML, we first need to understand it’s history. 
    When the Internet was in its infancy, there were many organizations writing their own markup for their own communication. 
    Company X would use specific tags that made logical sense to them while Company Y would write their own unique tags.

As the Internet expanded to impact more people across more organizations and countries, 
    a unification of meaning was needed. That unification is what we call the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
    The W3C was formed in 1994 to create international standards for the World Wide Web. 
    We use the ever-changing W3C standards today. 
    You can find the official standards of the W3C here: https://www.w3.org/standards///

If we didn’t have standards for the web, we would end up with thousands of lines of markup to describe the same thing.
    In fact, because browsers can render matching XML tags, we could experience this ourselves. Let’s look at an example:


<lambdaSchool>My custom Lambda tag!</lambdaSchool>  

The <lambdaSchool> tag renders correctly in the browser! We can even style our newly created tag:

lambdaSchool {
  color: red;
}

This is a small example of why we need standards when writing HTML. 
    If we could write custom tags for everything, 
    we would be in a state of constant confusion across development teams and organizations.
