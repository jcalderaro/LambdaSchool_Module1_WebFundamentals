<div> Tags Aren’t Bad

In the example above, we shed a bit of bad light on using divs with classes, 
    but the reality is that often, you need a div to get the job done. 
    When do we use div tags? Whenever we don’t need to describe meaning. 
    Using a div to create space, add structure, or style elements is just fine. 
    The concept of using markup like this is called presentational HTML.

Presentational HTML does not convey meaning. 
    It is used to achieve something the designer or client wanted but perhaps doesn’t contain meaning.
    An example of this would be:

<section>
  <div>
    <p>Half the content here should go here.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>The other half here should go here.</p>
  </div>
</section>

Notice how we can use the <section> tag to wrap the content, 
    but we could split the content into two halves using divs. 
    Semantically we are still using <section>, and at the same time, 
    we are using presentational <div> tags to split the content in half. 
    We could then use CSS on our divs to split the content without hurting the semantic structure.
