Semantic HTML Tutorial

Be sure to follow along with the code examples presented here!

Semantic HTML is all about providing meaning to our content. 
Let’s look at some content and think about how we could add meaning to it. 
Study the content below:

<!-- Main heading -->
Lambda School

<!-- Navigation -->
Tracks
About
Blog
Apply Now

<!-- Secondary heading -->
A Revolutionary New School
That Invests in You

<!-- Site content -->
Lambda School is a 30 week, immersive program that gives you the tools and training you need to launch your new career—from the comfort of your own home.

Step 1: Main Heading

When someone is searching for Lambda School, 
    they are most likely going to type “Lambda School” into the search bar.

We need our content to be marked up so that search engines can successfully find Lambda School.
    To do this, we can wrap our heading (or title) in a <h1> tag.

<h1>Lambda School</h1>

The <h1> tag is providing meaning to the search engine by informing any 
    indexing tools that we want “Lambda School” to be most important.

We are also telling the next developer that “Lambda School” is the most important content on the page.

Let’s keep marking up our code by looking at the navigation content.

Step 2: Header

<h1>Lambda School</h1>

<!-- Navigation -->
Tracks
About
Blog
Apply Now

At this point, we want to define a header (upper portion) for our document. 
We can use the <header> tag to wrap both the main heading (or title) and navigation items like this:

<header>
  <h1>Lambda School</h1>

  <!-- Navigation -->
  Tracks
  About
  Blog
  Apply Now
</header>

Now that we have our header in place let’s finish marking the navigation items up using the <nav> tag with nested <a> elements:

<header>
  <h1>Lambda School</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="#">Tracks</a>
    <a href="#">About</a>
    <a href="#">Blog</a>
    <a href="#">Apply Now</a>
  </nav>
</header>

By using the <nav> tag we are making it clear what the intent of that block of code is. 
    The nested <a> tags don’t currently link anywhere so we can put
    the # symbol in the href value to refresh the page for now.

Step 3: Secondary Heading and Site Content Section

Now that we have our main heading and navigation in place, we can look at the secondary heading and site content. 
    Before we markup the code, take a look at the content and think: “How should I organize this?”

<!-- Secondary heading -->
A Revolutionary New School
That Invests in You

<!-- Site content -->
Lambda School is a 30 week, immersive program that gives you the tools.

The secondary heading and site content go together. We could use a <section> tag to organize both the secondary heading and site content together.

We can also markup the secondary heading with a <h2>, and the site content could be a paragraph or <p> tag.

<section>
  <!-- Secondary heading -->
  <h2>A Revolutionary New School
  That Invests in You</h2>

  <!-- Site content -->
  <p>Lambda School is a 30 week, immersive program that gives you the tool.</p>
</section>

HTML has multiple heading tags. When we use them depends on what order we want the content to be understood by search engines.

Using <h2> after <h1> tells the search engines that the secondary heading isn’t as important as the main heading.
