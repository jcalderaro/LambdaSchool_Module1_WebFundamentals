Semantic HTML5

The W3C uses the word recommended to describe the most up to date web standards. 
    The current recommended standard for HTML markup is HTML5. HTML5 comes with more meaningful 
    tags to better describe our code. We use the word semantic to describe tags with meaning.

Some examples of semantic tags include:

<h1>
<p>
<section>
<nav>
<header>
<footer>

Notice that you can quickly figure out what each tag listed should be described in HTML.   
    The fact that you can read the tag and know more about its meaning instantly 
    is a direct example of why we say it’s semantic HTML.

Compare the semantic tags above with this list of non-semantic tags below:

<div class=”main-content”></div>
<div class=”nav”></div>
<span class=”orange”></span>
<div class=”footer”></div>

Note, that while you can get information from the class names, 
    you are at the mercy of the original developer’s naming convention, spelling, and meaning.

At this point, we can see the advantage of semantic markup for web developers. 
    The clarity and meaning should be found right in the tags. 
    There is another large advantage in writing semantically correct code: 
    computer algorithms consuming your code.

Search engines are algorithms looking for meaning. 
    If your code has a lot of divs without meaning, 
    you could lose out on valuable search engine optimization ranking. 
    Knowing that both humans and machines prefer semantic code, 
    we should get some practice writing it and knowing when to use it.
