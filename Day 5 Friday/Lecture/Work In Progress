    This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the
past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS
techniques using Responsive Design and Preprocessing. During this Sprint, you 
studied how to use the viewport meta tag, media queries, setting up a preprocessor,
and advanced use of preprocessing techniques. In your challenge this week, you will
demonstrate proficiency by updating a website that is missing 
content as well as adding mobile styling.
